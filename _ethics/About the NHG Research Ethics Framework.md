<h4><strong>Research Ethics Framework</strong></h4>
<p>All research involving patients, staff, premises, or facilities of NHG
institutions and all other institutions under the oversight of NHG Domain
Specific Review Board (DSRB) must be reviewed and approved by DSRB prior
to initiation.</p>
<p>All approved research projects must comply with DSRB requirements as outlined
in the NHG DSRB Investigator Manual. The DSRB requirements are based on
Declaration of Helsinki and the ethical principles in the Belmont Report.
The DSRB requirements are also compliant with the guidelines stipulated
by the Bioethics Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>In addition, the DSRB has a number of templates to facilitate researchers
in the ethics approval application process, such as templates for 'Participant
Information Sheet &amp; Consent Form' and 'Study Protocol'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NHG Investigator Manual, together with many other resources and templates
for investigators can be found and available here. ( <strong><a href="https://www.research.nhg.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/romp/nhgromp/resources" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>downloaded here</u></a></strong>.)</p>
