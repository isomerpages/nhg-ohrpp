<h4><strong>Outcomes of Review</strong></h4>
<p>Following the review of a research protocol, the DSRB will reach one of
the following decisions:
<br>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Approved</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The research proposal is approved as submitted. No changes are required.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Conditionally Approved</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There are no major problems with the proposal. Issues listed by the DSRB
must be addressed before the study can be formally approved. Subjects must
not be recruited into the study until final approval has been issued.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Tabled for next convened meeting</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>A proposal may be tabled if there are significant questions raised that
need further information from the Principal Investigator. The DSRB decides
on the subsequent action required. The Principal Investigator may be asked
to submit additional information, may be invited to a subsequent meeting
or the proposal might be sent to an Independent Consultant for further
review. When additional information has been obtained, the proposal is
discussed at the next DSRB meeting.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion-group isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Not Approved</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The proposal fails to meet one or more criteria used by the DSRB for approval
of research. Disapproval cannot be given through the expedited review and
may only be given by majority vote at a DSRB convened meeting.</p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Appeals to DSRB Decision</strong></h4>
<p>If the DSRB determines that a study is not approved, the reasons for the
disapproval will be provided in the outcome letter to the Principal Investigator.</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator may appeal against the DSRB decision by responding
in writing to the DSRB. This written response should contain the rational
for the appeal.
<br>
<br>Once the study has been included in the agenda, the Principal Investigator
will be notified and will be given the opportunity to attend the meeting
and present the information in person.
<br>
<br>The DSRB will carefully and fairly evaluate the Principal Investigator’s
response in reaching the final decision. If the study is disapproved, the
outcome letter will include the reason(s) for the disapproval.</p>
<p>If the Principal Investigator is dissatisfied with the decision, the Principal
Investigator may write to the Research Ethics Committee (REC). The REC
will then discuss the study and the DSRB’s decision at the next scheduled
meeting.</p>
