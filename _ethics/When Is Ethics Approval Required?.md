<p>Any study which involves systematic investigation, including research
development, testing, and evaluation, and are designed to develop or contribute
to generalizable knowledge is considered research and will require NHG
DSRB review and approval if it involves patients, staff, premises or facilities
of NHG institutions and all other institutions under the oversight of NHG
DSRB.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h4><br><strong>Why is DSRB Approval Required?</strong></h4>
<p>All research proposals that intend to enroll human subjects must meet
certain criteria before study procedures can be initiated. The criteria
are based on the principles of respect for persons, beneficence and justice
as discussed in the Belmont Report.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Principal Investigator is strongly encouraged to submit their application
well before the deadline for submission to allow some time for the DSRB
to check for any missing documents for information. The DSRB relies solely
on the documentation submitted by the Principal Investigator for review.</p>
<h4><br><strong>Which research activities requires DSRB Approval?</strong></h4>
<p>Types of studies that may require DSRB Approval:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Case series (3 or more subjects)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Database studies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tissue Repositories</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Types of studies that may not require DSRB Approval:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Case reports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outbreak investigations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disease Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infection Control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality Assessment &amp; Improvement (QA/QI)*.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* This </em><strong><a href="https://www.research.nhg.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/63e46d50-54ab-45d4-9c54-727cb263a25f/QA+QI+Checklist+v30june+2020.docx?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=nfD5Ktg&amp;CVID=nfD5Ktg&amp;CVID=nfD5Ktg&amp;CVID=nfD5Ktg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Checklist</u></a></strong><em> may be used to determine if a QA / QI study requires DSRB review. Where the response to&nbsp; all&nbsp; questions&nbsp; in&nbsp; the&nbsp; QA&nbsp; /&nbsp; QI checklist is “No”, and where there is no intention to share the information with others (i.e. contributing to generalisable knowledge) at the onset of the study, the QA / QI study will not be subject to DSRB review.</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When in doubt whether an activity requires DSRB review and approval, the
Principal Investigator may contact the DSRB and provide a summary of the
proposal for a preliminary assessment. The Principal Investigator may submit
an application for the DSRB to review. The DSRB will issue a notification
to the Principal Investigator if the DSRB determines that the proposal
does not require review/approval.</p>
<h4><strong>What are the criteria for DSRB Approval?</strong></h4>
<p>The DSRB will consider the following elements of review which are also
the minimum criteria for DSRB approval for new applications, study amendments
and continuing review:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risks to subjects are minimised by using procedures which are consistent
with sound research design, do not unnecessarily expose subjects to risks,
and when appropriate already being performed for diagnostic or treatment
purpose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits,
if any, to subject and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably
be expected to result.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment, the DSRB
will take into action account the following:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><em>The purpose of the research</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The setting in which the research will be conducted.</em>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Special problems of research involving vulnerable populations (i.e. children, prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons or economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.)</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or the subject’s
legally acceptable representative, in accordance, and to the extent requirements
for Research Involving Children.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Informed consent will be appropriately documented.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy
of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When some or all of the subjects are likely to be vulnerable (i.e. children,
prisoners, pregnant women, mentally disabled persons or economically or
educationally disadvantaged persons), to coercion or undue influence additional
safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare
of these subjects.</p>

</ul>
