<p>The <strong>Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Unit</strong> under the <strong>NHG</strong>  <strong>Office of Human Subject Research Protection Program (OHRPP)</strong> aims
to equip our researchers with the knowledge of best practices in research
to guide them in making the right decisions. This would be especially applicable
in instances that challenge inpidual values and integrity.</p>
<p>RCR looks at upholding the professionalism of research and the integrity
of research, which is the operative principle. Although research regulations
and guidelines abound, there still exists instances whereby there are no
clear-cut answers. At times like these, individual values and integrity
may be challenged, and the onus falls upon the researcher to determine
what is right.</p>
<p>RCR encourages researchers to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Honestly report research findings/ information truthfully while honoring
commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accurately and thoroughly report research data and take caution to avoid
errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize resources effectively and avoid wastage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objectively allow the facts to present itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abide to the laws and standards set by individual’s profession, discipline,
institutions and relevant laws.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The components of RCR are summarized as follows.</p>
<p>1. Research Misconduct</p>
<p>(A) RCR Research Misconduct Event(s) is defined as Falsification, Fabrication
or Plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting
research results.</p>
<p>(B) A RCR Event may refer research misconduct events as defined above
or any other RCR Event(s) that may be categorized under one of the components
listed above.</p>
<p></p>
<p>What to do if there is suspected Research Misconduct?</p>
<p>OHRPP recommends that the Whistle-Blower (the individual reporting the
suspected research misconduct) adheres to his/her institution’s policies
and or guidelines for whistle-blowing if there is suspected research misconduct.</p>

<p>2. Protection of Human Subjects</p>
<p>Researchers have the responsibility of obtaining appropriate approval
before conducting research involving human subjects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>3. Conflicts of Interests (COI) &amp; Commitment</p>
<p>Researchers should recognize the Conflicts of Interest that are crucial
and that there are required steps to be taken to ensure that they do not
interfere with the responsible practice of research.</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Data Management Practices</p>
<p>Researchers should be familiar with the important considerations for data
management.</p>
<p></p>
<p>5. Mentor and Trainee Responsibilities</p>
<p>Researchers should understand the basic responsibilities of mentor-trainee
relationship so as to ultimately produce independent and responsible researchers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>6. Collaborative Research</p>
<p>Researchers should appreciate that effective collaboration begins with
a clear understanding of roles and relationships, good collaboration requires
effective management plans and appreciate that different institutions may
have different research practices.</p>
<p></p>
<p>7. Authorship and Publication</p>
<p>Researchers should appreciate the minimum standards of responsible publications,
understand the elements of a responsible publication, appreciate what contributes
to responsible authorship and be aware of practices to avoid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>8. Peer Review</p>
<p>Researchers should understand the qualities of responsible peer review,
the importance of meeting deadlines for review, the importance of assessing
quality of the research paper, appreciate the role of the reviewer to judge
the importance of the research and understand the importance of preserving
confidentiality.</p>
<p>9. The Welfare of Lab Animals</p>
<p>Researchers intending to use animals in their research should know what
activities are subject to regulation(s), understand and follow the rules
for research approval, obtain appropriate training and accept continuing
responsibility for compliance through all stages of the research.</p>
