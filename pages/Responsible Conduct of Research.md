<p><strong>NHG Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Manual</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)</strong> is and can be learned
in multifarious ways and standards for RCR may vary from department to
department and possibly institution to institution. In numerous instances,
more than one response to a RCR situation may be considered acceptable
research practice.</p>
<p>The NHG-RCR Manual will describe the core components of RCR (along with
recommended guides to carry out research responsibly).</p>
