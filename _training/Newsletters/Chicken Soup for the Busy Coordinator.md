<h4><strong>Chicken Soup for the Busy Coordinator</strong></h4>
<p>The Clinical Research Coordinator Society (CRCS) is aware that our multi-tasking
coordinators often have to deal with ambiguous problems and situations.
With this in mind, the Society launched the regular Chicken Soup emails
in January 2008. These emails serve as bite-size educational resources
for Clinical Research Coordinators.
<br>
<br>The monthly Chicken Soup emails are easy to read and contain essential
information and practical knowledge that can be applied at work. We hope
that the Chicken Soup will indeed be a nourishing resource for you!</p>
