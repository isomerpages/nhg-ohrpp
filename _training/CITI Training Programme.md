<h4><strong>CITI Modules on Responsible Conduct of Research </strong>(Optional)</h4>
<p>CITI modules on RCR seek to educate researchers and research staff on
the responsible conduct of research in fields such as Biomedical Sciences,
Research Administration and Social, Behavioral &amp; Education Sciences

individual values and integrity.</p>
