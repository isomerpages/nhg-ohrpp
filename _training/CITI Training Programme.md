<h4><strong>CITI Modules on Responsible Conduct of Research </strong>(Optional)</h4>
<p>CITI modules on RCR seek to educate researchers and research staff on
the responsible conduct of research in fields such as Biomedical Sciences,
Research Administration and Social, Behavioural &amp; Education Sciences
through thinking questions. Our researchers will be equipped with the knowledge
of research best practices to guide them in making the right decisions
for the integrity of their research, especially in instances that challenge
individual values and integrity.</p>
<p>We encourage institutions to urge research staff to participate and learn
about Responsible Conduct of Research through these online elective modules.</p>
