<p>The NHG OHRPP &amp; her units regularly publish a range of newsletters
that are intended to educate and inform the NHG research community, and
to foster a research culture grounded in high ethical standards.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Catalyst</strong></h4>
<p>Published by NHG Group Research &amp; Innovation (GRI), the Catalyst focuses
on frontline research issues and targets the research community as its
core readership. Catalyst has evolved from a hardcopy magazine to an online
research newsletter e-Catalyst since Feb/Mar 2015.</p>
<p>Each issue, published quarterly, is carefully planned for, with the articles
strategically selected and finally put together for your reading pleasure.</p>

<h4><strong>OHRPP Post-Its</strong></h4>
<p>OHRPP Post-Its is a quarterly newsletter published by the NHG Office of
Human Research Protection Programme (OHRPP). It serves to provide the research
community with the latest news and update on research policies, SOPs, training
events, educational resources and research tools from OHRPP to facilitate
research conduct operating on high ethical standards.</p>

<h4><strong>Qualité</strong></h4>
<p>Qualité (Quality in French) is a quarterly to bi-monthly newsletter published
by NHG Research Education (RE) with a focus in educating researchers and
clinical research professionals on research policies, best practices and
Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) concepts to facilitate high standards
of research conduct.
<br>
<br>The newsletter also regularly features common cases of non-compliances
detected by the NHG Research Quality management Unit through Study Reviews
conducted, meant to educate the research community on the proper conduct
of research and with tips and recommendations for the prevention of similar
occurrence.</p>

<h4><strong>Chicken Soup for the Busy Coordinator</strong></h4>
<p>The Clinical Research Coordinator Society (CRCS) is aware that our multi-tasking
coordinators often have to deal with ambiguous problems and situations.
With this in mind, the Society launched the regular Chicken Soup emails
in January 2008. These emails serve as bite-size educational resources
for Clinical Research Coordinators.
<br>
<br>The monthly Chicken Soup emails are easy to read and contain essential
information and practical knowledge that can be applied at work. We hope
that the Chicken Soup will indeed be a nourishing resource for you!</p>
