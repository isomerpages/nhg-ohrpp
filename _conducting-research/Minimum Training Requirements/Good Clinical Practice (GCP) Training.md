<h4><strong>GCP Training for Principal Investigators and Site Principal Investigators</strong></h4>
<p>It is essential that Principal Investigators and Site Principal Investigators
of clinical trials receive Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training prior
to the initiation of a clinical trial as they are responsible for ensuring
the proper conduct of the clinical trial and safety of the subjects by
adhering to the relevant local regulations and guidelines.</p>

<p>Experienced speakers from various clinical research-related sectors will
deliver a series of lectures covering the following broad elements:
<br>• Core principles of Good Clinical Practice and ethical research;
<br>• Local regulatory requirements and legal framework for clinical trials;
<br>• Responsibilities of the sponsor and investigator;
<br>• Procedures related to the operationalisation and conduct of clinical
trials.</p>

<p>For STM: * Significant trial related tasks include informed consent taking,
eligibility assessment, IP management, key efficacy, and safety assessment
etc. You may refer to <strong><a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/clinical-trials/conducting/principal-investigator" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>HSA</u></a></strong> website

<p>The DSRB will recognise generic GCP courses (such as CITI GCP) and trainings
as meeting the acceptable minimum training standard. The DSRB does not
mandate a specific validity period for these GCP training certificates.
However, individuals should ensure that their trainings remain relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A valid GCP training certificate is required to be uploaded and verified
by the Minimum Training Secretariat on ECOS, prior to the submission of
new Clinical Trials and amendments.</p>

<summary><strong>(3) Is the completion of GCP training considered a minimum training for Population Health Research (Submission to DSRB Domain F)?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Investigators who are conducting population health research <strong><u>may not</u></strong> substitute
completion of GCP Course for the CITI Program. This is because the contents
covered in the GCP Course focuses on clinical trials involving medicinal/therapeutic
products or devices, which are not relevant to the population health research.</p>

<p>Note: Only courses that cover Singapore’s regulatory requirements and
legal framework for clinical trials are likely to meet the criteria for
recognition and should be submitted for review.</p>
