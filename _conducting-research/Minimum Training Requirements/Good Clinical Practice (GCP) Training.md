<h4><strong>GCP Training for Principal Investigators and Site Principal Investigators</strong></h4>
<p>It is essential that Principal Investigators and Site Principal Investigators
of clinical trials receive Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training prior
to the initiation of a clinical trial as they are responsible for ensuring
the proper conduct of the clinical trial and safety of the subjects by
adhering to the relevant local regulations and guidelines.</p>

<p>The<strong>&nbsp;</strong>ICH E6 (R3) GCP Principles will be effective&nbsp;<strong><u>1 January 2026</u></strong>&nbsp;in
Singapore.</p>
<p>The E6 (R3) guideline outlines GCP principles within the changing environment
of clinical trials, fostering innovations in trial design, operational
methods, and technological progress. It advocates for a quality-by-design
and risk-proportionate strategy in conducting clinical trials.</p>
<p>It is crucial for&nbsp;<strong>all investigators</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>other study team members involved in significant trial-related tasks</strong>&nbsp;to
be knowledgeable about the ICH E6 (R3) GCP requirements to ensure ethical
standards and subject safety in clinical trials, ultimately enhancing the&nbsp;<u>credibility and reliability&nbsp;</u>of
trial outcomes.</p>

<p>The DSRB will recognise generic GCP courses (such as CITI GCP) and trainings
as meeting the acceptable minimum training standard. The DSRB does not
mandate a specific validity period for these GCP training certificates.
However, individuals should ensure that their trainings remain relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A valid GCP training certificate is required to be uploaded and verified
by the Minimum Training Secretariat on ECOS, prior to the submission of
new Clinical Trials and amendments.</p>
