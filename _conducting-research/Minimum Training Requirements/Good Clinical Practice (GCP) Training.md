<h4><strong>GCP Training for Principal Investigators and Site Principal Investigators</strong></h4>
<p>It is essential that Principal Investigators and Site Principal Investigators
of clinical trials receive Good Clinical Practice (GCP) training prior
to the initiation of a clinical trial as they are responsible for ensuring
the proper conduct of the clinical trial and safety of the subjects by
adhering to the relevant local regulations and guidelines.</p>

<p>The DSRB will recognise generic GCP courses (such as CITI GCP) and trainings
as meeting the acceptable minimum training standard. The DSRB does not
mandate a specific validity period for these GCP training certificates.
However, individuals should ensure that their trainings remain relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A valid GCP training certificate is required to be uploaded and verified
by the Minimum Training Secretariat on ECOS, prior to the submission of
new Clinical Trials and amendments.</p>
