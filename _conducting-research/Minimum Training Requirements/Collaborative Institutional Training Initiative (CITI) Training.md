<h4><strong>About CITI Training</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) Training</strong> is
a leading provider of research education content that is web-based to facilitate
the training of investigators and staff who are conducting research.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who Should Complete the CITI Program?</strong></h4>
<p>All <strong>Principal Investigators (PI)</strong>, <strong>Site Principal Investigators (Site PI)</strong> and <strong>Co-Investigators (Co-I)</strong> of
research conducted within NHG and partner institutions are required to
complete the <strong>CITI Program “Biomedical Research Investigators and Key Personnel” course</strong> so
as to be able to appreciate and apply the ethical principles underlying
research to their day-to-day practice of research.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Waiver of CITI Training Requirement</strong>
</p>
<p>PIs, Site PIs and Co-Is who have completed the <strong>Singapore Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (SGGCP)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Course</strong> do
not need to complete the CITI Program. The SGGCP/GCP Course may be used
as an alternate minimum training requirement.</p>
<p>The DSRB will continue to accept and review applications from Investigators
who have yet to complete the CITI Program or GCP Course. However, the DSRB
will&nbsp;<strong>NOT </strong>grant ethics approval for the applications
until receipt of the Investigator's CITI or SGGCP/GCP certificates.</p>

<summary><strong>(5) I’ve completed other research ethics training programmes, can I use it to waive the completion of the CITI Program?</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The DSRB also accepts the SGGCP/GCP certificate as completion of the minimum
training requirements.</p>
<p>However, if you have completed other research ethics training programmes
that are organised and conducted by a reputable body such as NHG institutions,
Health Sciences Authority, National University of Singapore etc., you may
apply for a waiver of the CITI Program for DSRB’s evaluation.</p>
<p>Any programme that qualifies as a research ethics training equivalent
to the CITI Program, should be at least an 8-hour programme and should
address most of the following topics:
<br>(1) History &amp; Ethics Principles of Research Ethics
<br>(2) Regulatory Framework and Guidelines in Singapore
<br>(3) Informed Consent
<br>(4) Privacy and Confidentiality Issues</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please note that the <strong>National University Health System GCP Training Course</strong>  <strong><u>cannot</u></strong> be
used to waive the completion of the CITI Program.</p>
