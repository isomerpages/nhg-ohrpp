<h4><strong>Introduction to Minimum Training Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>With Singapore’s push to become a regional hub for biomedical research
and the increasing number of clinical trials, there is a growing need to
ensure that all key investigators, such as the Principal Investigators,
Site Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators and other staff who are
involved in research activities have basic research ethics training. The
intent of having minimum training requirements is for Principal Investigators
and the research community to appreciate and apply the underlying ethical
principles to their day-to-day research practice.</p>
<h4><strong>Minimum Training Requirements for Staff from NHG Health and Partner Institutions</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>There are 3 main types of training courses available:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative’s (CITI Program) Investigator’s
Course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial Conflicts of Interest (FCOI) Course (sub-component of the CITI
Program)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Course (based on ICH GCP, Singapore regulations
and local IRB requirements)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The minimum training requirements for Staff from NHG Health and partner
institution differ according to their study roles. The Table below summarizes
the minimum training requirements.</p>

<p><strong><sup>1 </sup></strong>All investigators, study team members and
external institution staff involved in the design, conduct or reporting
of research in institutions under the oversight of NHG Health DSRB are
required to complete the <strong><a href="https://ethics.gri.nhg.com.sg/fcoi-training/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) Course</a></strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The DSRB will recognise generic GCP courses
and training as acceptable minimum training requirement. PIs, Site-PIs
Co-Is and other study team members may complete either local or overseas
GCP training programmes, e.g., CITI ICH E6 (R3) GCP Training Course, general
GCP training provided by sponsor companies. PIs, Site PIs and Co-Is who
have completed the ICH GCP course may use it as an alternative minimum
requirement for <strong>biomedical research studies only</strong>. Refer
to the <strong><a href="https://ethics.gri.nhg.com.sg/good-clinical-practice-gcp-training/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training</u></a></strong> for
more information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><sup> </sup>Mandatory for Study Team Members
(STM) conducting significant trial related tasks (informed consent, eligibility
assessment, investigational product management, key efficacy, and safety
assessments, etc.) to complete <strong>GCP</strong> training before study
involvement. Refer to the <strong><a href="https://ethics.gri.nhg.com.sg/good-clinical-practice-gcp-training/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training</u></a></strong> for

<p></p>
<p><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><sup> </sup>HBR Minimum Training to be completed

design, conduct or reporting of HBR studies:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p><strong>PI, Site PI, Co-I </strong>: <u>Before</u> new HBR IRB submissions
and amendments for HBR studies in ECOS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CRCs, RAs, other study team members:</strong>  <u>Prior</u> to the
commencement of their study involvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;For Investigators and study team members from NHG Health partner institutions, please refer to the respective Research Institution (RI) HBR minimum training requirements.</strong>
</p>
<p>The SingHealth CIRB requirements will apply to staff from SingHealth and

submitted to DSRB for review. Refer to the <strong><a href="https://www.singhealthdukenus.com.sg/research/rice/training-requirements" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CIRB website</u></a></strong> for
