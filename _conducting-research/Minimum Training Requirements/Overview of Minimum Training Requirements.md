<h4><strong>Introduction to Minimum Training Requirements</strong></h4>
<p>With Singapore’s push to become a regional hub for biomedical research
and the increasing number of clinical trials, there is a growing need to
ensure that all key investigators, such as the Principal Investigators,
Site Principal Investigators, Co-Investigators and other staff who are
involved in research activities have basic research ethics training. The
intent of having minimum training requirements is for Principal Investigators
and the research community to appreciate and apply the underlying ethical
principles to their day-to-day research practice.</p>
<h4><strong>Minimum Training Requirements for Staff from NHG and Partner Institutions</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>There are 3 main types of training courses available:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative’s (CITI Program) Investigator’s
Course</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial Conflicts of Interest (FCOI) Course (sub-component of the CITI
Program)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Course (based on ICH GCP, Singapore regulations
and local IRB requirements)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The minimum training requirements for Staff from NHG and partner institution
differ according to their study roles. The Table below summarizes the minimum
training requirements.</p>

<p><strong><sup>1 </sup></strong>All investigators, study team members and
external institution staff involved in the design, conduct or reporting
of research in institutions under the oversight of NHG DSRB are required
to complete the <strong><a href="https://www.research.nhg.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/romp/nhgromp/06+conducting+research/fcoi+intro" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Financial Conflict of Interest (FCOI) course</u></a></strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><sup>2 </sup></strong>The DSRB will recognise generic GCP courses
and training as acceptable minimum training requirement. PIs, Site-PIs
Co-Is and other study team members may complete either local or overseas
GCP training programmes, e.g., ICH GCP training organized by NHG and SingHealth,
CITI GCP Course, general GCP training provided by sponsor companies. PIs,
Site PIs and Co-Is who have completed the ICH GCP course may use it as
an alternative minimum requirement for <strong>biomedical research studies only</strong>.
Refer to the <strong><a href="https://www.research.nhg.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/romp/nhgromp/06+conducting+research/sggcp+intro" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training</u></a></strong> for
more information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><sup>3</sup></strong><sup> </sup>Mandatory for Study Team Members
(STM) conducting significant trial related tasks (informed consent, eligibility
assessment, investigational product management, key efficacy, and safety
assessments, etc.) to complete <strong>GCP</strong> training before study
involvement. Refer to the <strong><a href="https://www.research.nhg.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/romp/nhgromp/06+conducting+research/sggcp+intro" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Training</u></a></strong> for
more information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><sup>4</sup></strong><sup> </sup>HBR Minimum Training to be completed
by all NHG Investigators and study team members involved in the design,
conduct or reporting of HBR studies:&nbsp;</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>PI, Site PI, Co-I </strong>: <u>Before</u> new HBR IRB submissions
and amendments for HBR studies in ECOS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CRCs, RAs, other study team members:</strong>  <u>Prior</u> to the
commencement of their study involvement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Partners who have collaborations with NHG have their own HBR Minimum Training
(e.g., SingHealth, NUHS)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partners should contact their Research Institution (RI) / CRU/ RO regarding
their cluster’s/institution’s minimum training policy/requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The SingHealth CIRB requirements will apply to staff from SingHealth and
partner institutions who are involved in cross-cluster studies that are
submitted to DSRB for review. Refer to the <strong><a href="http://research.singhealth.com.sg/Pages/CentralisedInstitutionalReviewBoard.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>CIRB website</u></a></strong> for
more details.</p>
