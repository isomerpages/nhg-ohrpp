<p>All Principal Investigators (PIs), Site Principal Investigators (Site
PIs) and Co-Investigators (Co-Is) of research conducted within NHG and
partner institutions are required to complete the CITI Program’s Investigator’s
Course.</p>
<p>PIs, Site PIs and Co-Is who have completed the Singapore Guideline for
Good Clinical Practice (SGGCP)/Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Course do not
need to complete the CITI Program. The SGGCP/GCP Course may be used as
an alternate minimum training requirement.</p>
<p>The DSRB will continue to accept and review applications from Investigators
who have yet to complete the CITI Program or GCP Course. However, the DSRB
will&nbsp;NOT grant ethics approval for the applications until receipt
of the Investigator's CITI or SGGCP/GCP certificates.</p>
