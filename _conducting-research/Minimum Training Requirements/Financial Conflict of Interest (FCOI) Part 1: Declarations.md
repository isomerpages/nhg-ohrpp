<h4><strong>PART I&nbsp;–&nbsp;FCOI Declaration Requirements&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>Investigators and study team members who are involved in research that
is conducted under the oversight of NHG or partner institutions should
not have conflicting interests that may adversely affect the protection
of participants or the credibility of the human subject protection programme.
<br>
<br>The <strong>definitions</strong> of Conflict of interest are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Interest</strong> – A conflicting interest can be broadly
defined to refer to any interest of the investigator and/or study team
member or immediate family (includes parents, siblings, spouse and each
dependent child) that competes with the investigator’s/study team member’s
obligation to protect the rights and welfare of research subjects.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Interest</strong> – Financial interest related to the
research means financial interest in the sponsor, product or service being
tested. Significant Financial Interest means anything of monetary value,
including but not limited to, salary or payments for services (e.g., consulting
fees or honoraria); equity interests (e.g. stocks, stock options or other
ownership interests); intellectual property rights (e.g., patents, copyrights
and royalties from such rights), and board or executive relationships.</p>
<p>Since <strong>1st January 2015</strong>, all <strong><u>investigators</u> </strong>and <strong><u>study team members</u> </strong>who
are involved in the <strong>design, conduct or reporting of research</strong> that
is conducted under the oversight of NHG or its partner institutions are
