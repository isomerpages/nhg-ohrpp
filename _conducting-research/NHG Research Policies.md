<h3><strong>Policies that Researchers should know</strong></h3>
<p>Prior to starting your research, we urge all researchers to familiarize
themselves with the following policies/guidelines:</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Manual</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the NHG Office of Human Research Protection Programme (OHRPP)’s
effort to promote the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) awareness within
our research community, we have put together this manual so that researchers
will be better equipped with knowledge about RCR and be better prepared
to deal with any integrity dilemma that they will invariably encounter
in their daily research activities and research career. The RCR Manual
will provide researchers with insights to the outlines of the overall governance
of research, provides procedural guidelines for meeting ethical requirements
in research, and offer guidance on key ethical issues.</p>

<h4><strong>NHG Investigator’s Manual</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure that our growing pool of PIs understand research ethics meaningfully,
the NHG Investigator’s Manual is a handy reference tool catering to both
new and experienced investigators alike.</p>
<p>This publication amalgamated the regulatory requirements, NHG DSRB research
policies and institutional policies governing research conduct, allowing
PIs to adeptly navigate the formidable convolutions of the research maze.
The Investigator’s Manual is both practical and useful and you will actively
use it to improve the ethical standards of your research.</p>

<h4><strong>NHG Proper Conduct of Research (PCR) SOPs and Templates</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG PCR SOPs and Templates are developed by NHG Group Research &amp;
Innovation to provide detailed procedures on conducting research in accordance
with applicable guidelines and regulations.</p>

<h4><strong>NHG Human Tissue Bank Policy, SOPs &amp; Templates</strong></h4>
<p>The purpose of the NHG Human Tissue Bank Policy, SOPs and Templates<strong> </strong>is
to outline the definitions, the establishment, ethical consideration, ownership,
governance and management of the NHG tissue banks for research to ensure
that tissue banking activities are in accordance with the requirements
of the Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA).</p>
