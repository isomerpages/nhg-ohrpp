<h3>Standing Databases &amp; Tissue Banks</h3>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>What are Standing Databases?</strong>
</p>
<p>Standing Databases contain electronic data stored for the purposes of
patient care / services and/or as a potential resource for future research.
For the purposes of these guidelines, any collected and arranged private
information stored electronically will be considered a database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are Tissue Banks?</strong>
</p>
<p>Tissue Banks contain tissue specimens stored for the purposes of patient
care / services and/or as a potential resource for future research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the purpose of registering a Standing Database / Tissue Bank?</strong>
</p>
<p>To allow NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to review key specific
issues pertaining to tissue and data banking, such as collection, storage,
privacy and confidentiality, and informed consent. With the registration,
custodians provide assurance to comply with NHG and BAC’s guidelines for
data and tissue banking activities for potential research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>For NHG Tissue Banks Only</strong>
<br>NHG Custodians can register their Tissue Banks by completing and submitting
the Tissue Bank Application Form to the NHG Tissue Compliance Committee
