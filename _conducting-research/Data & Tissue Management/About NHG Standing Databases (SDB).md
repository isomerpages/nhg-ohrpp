<h4><strong>What are Standing Databases?</strong></h4>
<p>Standing Databases contain electronic data stored for the purposes of
patient care / services and/or as a potential resource for future research.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these guidelines, any collected and arranged private
information stored electronically will be considered a database.</p>
<h4><strong>What is the Purpose of registering a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>To allow NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to review key specific
issues pertaining to tissue and data banking, such as collection, storage,
privacy and confidentiality, and informed consent. With the registration,
custodians provide assurance to comply with NHG and BACâ€™s guidelines for
data and tissue banking activities for potential research.</p>
<h4><strong>How to Register a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>With effect from 01 August 2020</strong>, all NHG Standing Database
applications will be routed to the <strong>NHG Research Data Institutional Deputies (IDs)</strong> for
approval.</p>
<p>NHG Custodians can register their Standing Database by completing and
submitting the Standing Database (SDB) Application Form to the NHG Research
Data Institutional Deputy.</p>
<p>Please note that you should only proceed with your standing database activities
after receiving approval from your ID.</p>
