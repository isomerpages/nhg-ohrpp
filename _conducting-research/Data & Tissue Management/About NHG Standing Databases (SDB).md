<h4><strong>What are Standing Databases?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Standing Databases (SDBs)</strong> contain electronic data stored
for the purposes of patient care / services and/or as a potential resource
for future research.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these guidelines, any collected and arranged private
information stored electronically will be considered a database.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>What is the Purpose of Registering a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>To allow NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to review key specific
issues pertaining to tissue and data banking, such as collection, storage,
privacy and confidentiality, and informed consent. With the registration,
custodians provide assurance to comply with NHG and BAC’s guidelines for
data and tissue banking activities for potential research.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who should be the “Owner” of the Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>The respective institutions/cluster (“Owner”) possesses ownership of Standing
Databases set up by their staff.</p>
<p>The <strong>Head of Department (HOD)</strong> is the appropriate authority
to endorse as “<strong>Owner</strong>” for Standing Databases created within
his/her department.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chairman Medical Board (CMB)</strong> or equivalent is the appropriate
authority to endorse as “Owner” for standing databases that straddle more
than one department in his/her institution. Standing Databases that straddle
more than one institution will require the endorsement by the CMBs or equivalents
of all institutions concerned.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who should be the “Custodian” of the Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>The “Owner” should appoint a suitable staff (“Custodian”) to be responsible
for the set up and maintenance (including security and access) of the Standing
Database.</p>
<p>If the "Custodian" leaves the employment of the institution, another employee
should be appointed as the new "Custodian". The "Custodian" should inform
the "Owner" when the Standing Database ceases to be useful and therefore
“shuts down”.</p>
<p>For large IT systems, the “Custodian” shall be synonymous with the appointed
“System Owner”.</p>
<p>Where there is shared ownership of a Standing Database amongst various
NHG or partner institutions, the "Owners" should agree upon the most suitable
"Custodian".</p>
<p>For Standing Databases that are set up with an external institution, institutions
within NHG should appoint an NHG "Custodian" to protect NHG’s interest
in the joint database.</p>
<p></p>
