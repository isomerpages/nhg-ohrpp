<h4><strong>Being a Principal Investigator (PI)</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Principal Investigator (PI)</strong> is an individual who assumes
the authority and responsibility for the conduct of a research study. The
PI has the authority to delegate responsibility to individual members of
the research team; however, the PI is ultimately responsible for the overall
conduct of the research study.</p>
<p>The PI(s) should have minimum ethical training to help them appreciate
and apply the ethical principles underlying research to the day-to-day
practice of research.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>This requirement is not solely for the purpose of the application to DSRB,
as the PI has the responsibility for ensuring that the conduct of the research
within NHG Health or its partner institutions is in compliance with Good
Clinical Practice (GCP) and all other applicable guidelines and regulations.</p>
