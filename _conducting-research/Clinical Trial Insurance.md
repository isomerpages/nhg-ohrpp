<h4><strong>Background on National Clinical Trial Insurance</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>National Clinical Trial (CT) Insurance</strong> is initiated
in 2015 by the Ministry of Health Holdings (MOHH) to facilitate the conduct
of clinical trials in Singapore by harmonising the policy terms and coverage
across all public healthcare institutions. All trials, studies, surveys,
researches conducted in Singapore by the public healthcare institutions
with ethics approval will be declared for insurance under the National
CT Insurance.
<br>
<br>The renewal for the National CT Insurance is conducted on an annual basis.
For NHG Health, the renewal will be facilitated by the NHG Health Group
Research&nbsp;Office (GRI)&nbsp;for all institutions under the NHG Health
cluster.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Report of a Claim</strong></h4>
<p>The National CT Insurance is a “claims-made” policy. As such, the insurer
will need to be notified as soon as possible in the event of a claim or
a potential claim arising. For NHG Health, institutions will raise claims
notification through the NHG Health Group Research.</p>
