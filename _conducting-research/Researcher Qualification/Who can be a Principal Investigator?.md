<p><strong>Being a Principal Investigator</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Principal Investigator (PI)</strong> is an individual who assumes
the authority and responsibility for the conduct of a research study. The
PI has the authority to delegate responsibility to individual members of
the research team; however, the PI is ultimately responsible for the overall
conduct of the research study.</p>
<p>The PI(s) should have minimum ethical training to help them appreciate
and apply the ethical principles underlying research to the day-to-day
practice of research.</p>
