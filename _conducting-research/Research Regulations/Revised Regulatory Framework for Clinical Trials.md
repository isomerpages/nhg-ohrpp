<p>&nbsp;<strong><u>3. Amendments to the Requirements for Clinical Research Material Containing Codeine Cough Preparations</u></strong>
</p>
<p>MOH has worked with HSA to make amendments to the Health Products (Therapeutic)
Regulations (“TP Regs”) to change the supply limits for sale and supply
of codeine cough preparations. Consequential to the amendments to the TP
Regs, the <a href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/clinical-trials/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>HSA Regulatory overview of clinical trials​</u></a> has
been amended to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Remove the codeine supply restrictions for clinical research materials,
in view of the existing research governance frameworks in place to curb
the abuse of codeine in the context of clinical research studies; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cover all dosage forms of codeine cough preparations, in the requirement
for export approval for consignments of codeine-containing clinical research
materials, to align with the requirements under the TP Regs.</p>
</li>
