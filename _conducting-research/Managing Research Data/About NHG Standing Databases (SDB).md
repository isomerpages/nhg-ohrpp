<h4><strong>What are Standing Databases?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Standing Databases (SDBs)</strong> contain electronic data stored
for the purposes of patient care / services and/or as a potential resource
for future research.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these guidelines, any collected and arranged private
information stored electronically will be considered a database.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>What is the Purpose of Registering a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>To allow NHG Health Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to review key
specific issues pertaining to tissue and data banking, such as collection,
storage, privacy and confidentiality, and informed consent. With the registration,
custodians provide assurance to comply with NHG and BAC’s guidelines for
data and tissue banking activities for potential research.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who should be the “Owner” of the Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>respective Institutions/Cluster (“Owner”)</strong> possesses
ownership of Standing Databases set up by their staff.</p>
<p>The <strong>Head of Department (HOD)</strong> is the appropriate authority
to endorse as “<strong>Owner</strong>” for Standing Databases created <strong>within his/her department</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chairman Medical Board (CMB)</strong> or equivalent is the appropriate
authority to endorse as “<strong>Owner</strong>” for standing databases
that <strong>straddle more than one department in his/her institution</strong>.
Standing Databases that straddle more than one institution will require
the endorsement by the CMBs or equivalents of all institutions concerned.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who should be the “Custodian” of the Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>The “Owner” should appoint a suitable staff (“Custodian”) to be responsible
for the set up and maintenance (including security and access) of the Standing
Database.</p>
<p>If the "Custodian" leaves the employment of the institution, another employee
should be appointed as the new "Custodian". The "Custodian" should inform
the "Owner" when the Standing Database ceases to be useful and therefore
“shuts down”.</p>
<p>For large IT systems, the “Custodian” shall be synonymous with the appointed
“System Owner”.</p>
<p>Where there is shared ownership of a Standing Database amongst various
NHG Health or partner institutions, the "Owners" should agree upon the
most suitable "Custodian".</p>
<p>For Standing Databases that are set up with an external institution, institutions
within NHG Health should appoint an NHG Health "Custodian" to protect NHG
Health’s interest in the joint database.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>How to Register a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>With effect from 01 August 2020</strong>, all NHG Health Standing
Database applications will be routed to the <strong>NHG Health Research Data Institutional Deputies (IDs)</strong> for
approval.</p>
