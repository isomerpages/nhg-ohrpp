<h4><strong>What are Standing Databases?</strong></h4>
<p>Research<strong> Standing Databases (SDBs)</strong> are structured collection
&amp; storage of individual-level personal information, for future research
purposes.</p>
<p>For the purposes of these guidelines, any collected and arranged private
information stored electronically will be considered a database.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>What is the Purpose of Registering a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>Registering a research Standing Database is crucial for NHG Health to
maintain ethical oversight ad ensure regulatory compliance. The registration
will allow the NHG Health to guide a custodian's research data collection
activities, including</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Data collection and storage procedures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Privacy and confidentiality measures</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informed consent documentation and processes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Custodians will need to comply with relevant policies, regulations and
guidelines including</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HealthTech Instruction Manual (HIM)</p>

<p>NHG Health Polices (e.g. <a href="https://healthsg.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/NHGHealth-RCU/Shared%20Library/Research%20Data/NHG%20Health%20Research%20Data%20Policy.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=jPXtuD" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">NHG Health Research Data Policy</a>,

<h4><strong>Who should be the “Owner” of the Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>respective Institutions/Cluster (“Owner”)</strong> possesses
ownership of Standing Databases set up by their staff.</p>
<p>The <strong>Head of Department (HOD)</strong> is the appropriate authority
to endorse as “<strong>Owner</strong>” for Standing Databases created <strong>within his/her department</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Chairman Medical Board (CMB)</strong> or equivalent is the appropriate
authority to endorse as “<strong>Owner</strong>” for standing databases
that <strong>straddle more than one department in his/her institution</strong>.
Standing Databases that straddle more than one institution will require
the endorsement by the CMBs or equivalents of all institutions concerned.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who should be the “Custodian” of the Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p>The “Owner” should appoint a suitable staff (“Custodian”) to be responsible
for the set up and maintenance (including security and access) of the Standing
Database.</p>
<p>If the "Custodian" leaves the employment of the institution, another employee
should be appointed as the new "Custodian". The "Custodian" should inform
the "Owner" when the Standing Database ceases to be useful and therefore
“shuts down”.</p>
<p>For large IT systems, the “Custodian” shall be synonymous with the appointed
“System Owner”.</p>
<p>Where there is shared ownership of a Standing Database amongst various
NHG Health or partner institutions, the "Owners" should agree upon the
most suitable "Custodian".</p>
<p>For Standing Databases that are set up with an external institution, institutions
within NHG Health should appoint an NHG Health "Custodian" to protect NHG
Health’s interest in the joint database.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>How to Register a Standing Database?</strong></h4>
<p><strong>With effect from 01 August 2020</strong>, all NHG Health Standing
Database applications will be routed to the <strong>NHG Health Research Data Institutional Deputies (IDs)</strong> for
approval.</p>
