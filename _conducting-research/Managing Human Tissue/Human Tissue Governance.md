<p>The <strong>Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA)</strong> came into effect
on 01 November 2017. The <strong>Human Tissue Framework (HTF)</strong> was
activated on 01 November 2019.</p>
<p>Under the HTF Framework, tissue banks must ensure that all tissue banking
activities are in compliance with the <strong>HBRA-HTF</strong> and its subsidiary
legislations and conducted in accordance with the <strong>NHG Tissue Bank Policy</strong>, <strong>Proper Conduct of Tissue Bank (PCT)</strong> SOPs
and institutional standards, and procedures.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Who will be impacted?</strong></h4>
<p>If you are involved in the collection, storage, procurement, importation,
supply, provision or exportation of human tissue to facilitate future research,
you may be subjected to the requirements of the HTF.</p>
<p>These may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Clinical/ diagnostic laboratories that supply left-over/ waste tissue
to researchers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researchers who collect tissue in excess for the sole purpose of storage
for future research;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Persons in possession of tissue, who are not involved in research, but
supply the tissue to other researchers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Updates to the Governance of Leftover Tissue for Future Research</strong></h4>
<p>MOH has affirmed that upon study completion, any leftover human tissue
to be stored for future research (research that has <strong><u>yet to obtain IRB approval</u></strong>)
will need to come under the governance of the HTF.</p>
<p>If you are storing leftover tissue for future research, please refer to
the table below for the required follow-up actions.</p>

<p>The above requirements will not apply to leftover tissue stored for future
research that <strong><u>has received IRB approval</u></strong>. This is
because such future research demonstrates clear research intent that can
be governed under the Human Biomedical Research (HBR) Framework. Hence,
HTF requirements need not apply.</p>

<h4><strong>NHG Governance Structure for Human Tissues</strong></h4>
<p>NHG is registered under MOH as a single "Mothership" Tissue Bank. Under
this <strong><u>governance structure</u></strong>, each NHG institution
has established an<strong> Institutional Tissue Bank Committee (ITBC)</strong> to
oversee institutional-level tissue banking activities. For more information
on the framework, <strong><a href="https://www.research.nhg.com.sg/wps/wcm/connect/6acf4ce9-47ac-4be3-bf8d-2a41ed245d1d/NHG+Tissue+Banks+Management+Framework.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH&amp;CVID=nfsgbwH" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>click here</u></a></strong> *.</p>

<h4><strong>About NHG Tissue Compliance Committee (TCC)</strong></h4>

and comprises representatives from each NHG institution.</p>
