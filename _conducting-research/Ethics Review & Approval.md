<h4><strong>Overview of the Ethics Review Process</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Application Process</strong>
</p>
<p>All research applications must be submitted to the DSRB via the ECOS.
<br>
<br>Once the Principal Investigator submits an application via ROAM, it will
be automatically routed to the Department Representative (DR) and subsequently
the Institution Representative (IR) for endorsement. The DSRB will receive
the application only after both the DR and IR have endorsed it.
<br>
<br>The Principal Investigator should select the most appropriate DSRB domain
to review their study. The DSRB may re-assign your application to another
Domain upon preliminary review of your application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Review Process</strong>
</p>
<p>Based on the level of risk in which research participants will be exposed
to, all research studies submitted will be classified under one of the
following review categories:
<br>
</p>
<div data-type="detailGroup" class="isomer-accordion isomer-accordion-white">
<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Exempt Review</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Research studies that involve anonymous surveys and questionnaires, collection
or study of anonymous existing data or tissue specimens, where data/tissue
are either publicly available or subjects cannot be identified, or public
benefit programmes.</p>
<p></p>

<summary><strong>Exempt Review</strong>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">

<p></p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary><strong>Full Board Review</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Research studies that do not qualify for exempt or expedited review will
be reviewed under full board review. Such studies may include research
studies that involve the study of the safety and efficacy of a medicinal
product, medical device, or research study that involve invasive procedures.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
</details>
</div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Studies that fall into the exempt and expedited review categories will
be reviewed by the Domain Chairperson at the weekly chair meeting. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Studies that require full board review will be reviewed at the monthly
convened meeting at which a quorum is present.
<br>
<br>All new applications accepted by the DSRB will be reviewed within thirty
calendar days. However, the time frame from submission to approval will
vary depending on factors such as the completeness of the application,
complexity of the study, the response of the Investigator to DSRB's queries
and availability of a meeting quorum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Review Criteria</strong>
</p>
<p>All research studies that intend to involve human subjects, use their
biological samples and/or data, must meet certain criteria before study
procedures can be initiated. The criteria are based on the principles of
autonomy, beneficence and justice as discussed in the Belmont Report.
<br>
<br>In general, a research study must fulfill the following criteria:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Risks are minimized, and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection of subjects is equitable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informed consent will be sought, and appropriately documented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adequate provision for monitoring of data to ensure safety, protection
of privacy of research participants and confidentiality of data collected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional protection for vulnerable populations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
