<p>The <strong>Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Unit</strong> under the <strong>NHG</strong>  <strong>Office of Human Subject Research Protection Program (OHRPP)</strong> aims
to equip our researchers with the knowledge of best practices in research
to guide them in making the right decisions. This would be especially applicable
in instances that challenge inpidual values and integrity.</p>
<p>RCR looks at upholding the professionalism of research and the integrity
of research, which is the operative principle. Although research regulations
and guidelines abound, there still exists instances whereby there are no
clear-cut answers. At times like these, individual values and integrity
may be challenged, and the onus falls upon the researcher to determine
what is right.</p>
<p>RCR encourages researchers to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Honestly report research findings/ information truthfully while honoring
commitments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accurately and thoroughly report research data and take caution to avoid
errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilize resources effectively and avoid wastage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objectively allow the facts to present itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abide to the laws and standards set by individual’s profession, discipline,
institutions and relevant laws.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Components of Responsible Conduct of Research</strong></h4>
<p>Responsible Conduct of Research is made up of the following components.</p>

<summary><strong>1. Research Misconduct</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>(A) RCR Research Misconduct Event(s) is defined as Falsification, Fabrication
or Plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing research, or in reporting
research results.</p>
<p>(B) A RCR Event may refer research misconduct events as defined above
or any other RCR Event(s) that may be categorized under one of the components
listed above.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What to do if there is suspected Research Misconduct?</strong>
</p>
<p>NHG OHRPP recommends that the Whistle-Blower (the individual reporting
the suspected research misconduct) adheres to his/her institution’s policies
and or guidelines for whistle-blowing if there is suspected research misconduct.</p>

<h4><strong>Responsible Conduct of Research Manual</strong></h4>
<p>Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) is and can be learned in multifarious
ways and standards for RCR may vary from department to department and possibly
institution to institution. In numerous instances, more than one response
to a RCR situation may be considered acceptable research practice.</p>
<p>The NHG-RCR Manual will describe the core components of RCR (along with
recommended guides to carry out research responsibly).</p>

<h4><strong>CITI Modules on Responsible Conduct of Research</strong></h4>
<p>CITI modules on RCR seek to educate researchers and research staff on
the responsible conduct of research in fields such as Biomedical Sciences,
Research Administration and Social, Behavioral &amp; Education Sciences
through thinking questions.</p>
