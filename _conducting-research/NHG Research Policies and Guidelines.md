<h3><strong>Policies &amp; Guidelines that Researchers should know</strong></h3>
<p>Prior to starting your research, we urge all researchers to familiarize
themselves with the following policies/guidelines:</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Manual</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the NHG Office of Human Research Protection Programme (OHRPP)’s
effort to promote the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) awareness within
our research community, we have put together this manual so that researchers
will be better equipped with knowledge about RCR and be better prepared
to deal with any integrity dilemma that they will invariably encounter
in their daily research activities and research career. The RCR Manual
will provide researchers with insights to the outlines of the overall governance
of research, provides procedural guidelines for meeting ethical requirements
in research, and offer guidance on key ethical issues.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Investigator’s Manual</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure that our growing pool of PIs understand research ethics meaningfully,
the NHG Investigator’s Manual is a handy reference tool catering to both
new and experienced investigators alike.</p>
<p>This publication amalgamated the regulatory requirements, NHG DSRB research
policies and institutional policies governing research conduct, allowing
PIs to adeptly navigate the formidable convolutions of the research maze.
The Investigator’s Manual is both practical and useful and you will actively
use it to improve the ethical standards of your research.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Proper Conduct of Research (PCR) SOPs and Templates</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG PCR SOPs and Templates are developed by NHG Group Research &amp;
Innovation to provide detailed procedures on conducting research in accordance
with applicable guidelines and regulations.</p>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Research Institution Policy</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG Research Institution (RI) Policy outlines the functions and duties
of NHG RI and duties of the NHG Principal Person-In-Charge (PIC) to fulfill
the requirements of the HBRA and describes the NHG research governance
framework that enables the RI to meet the requirements of the HBRA and
other relevant Acts and regulations applicable to research.</p>

<h4><strong>NHG Research Data Policy</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG Research Data Policy provides the framework for governing research
data to ensure compliance with the HBRA, Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA),
Healthtech Instruction Manual (HIM), Synapxe policies and all other relevant
regulations.</p>

<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Human Tissue Bank Policy</strong></h4>
<p>The purpose of the NHG Human Tissue Bank Policy is to outline the definitions,
the establishment, ethical consideration, ownership, governance and management
of the NHG tissue banks for research to ensure that tissue banking activities
are in accordance with the requirements of the Human Biomedical Research
Act (HBRA).</p>

<br>The Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC) was established by the Singapore
Cabinet in December 2000. It has been tasked to address the ethical, legal
and social issues arising from biomedical sciences research in Singapore.
The BAC actively gathers information and views from the international and
local community, and after careful deliberation, makes recommendations
to the Singapore Government on the regulation of human biomedical research.</p>

to ensure that human biomedical research and tissue banking activities
carried out in Singapore follow the law and principles of good clinical
practice relating to ethics and science to protect the safety and welfare
of research subjects and tissue donors.</p>
