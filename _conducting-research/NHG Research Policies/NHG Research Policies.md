<h3><strong>Policies that Researchers need to know</strong></h3>
<p>Prior to starting your research, we urge that you familiarize yourself
with the following policies/guidelines:</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>NHG Investigator’s Manual</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure that our growing pool of PIs understand research ethics meaningfully,
the NHG Investigator’s Manual is a handy reference tool catering to both
new and experienced investigators alike.</p>
<p>This publication amalgamated the regulatory requirements, NHG DSRB research
policies and institutional policies governing research conduct, allowing
PIs to adeptly navigate the formidable convolutions of the research maze.
The Investigator’s Manual is both practical and useful and you will actively
use it to improve the ethical standards of your research.</p>

<h4><strong>NHG Proper Conduct of Research (PCR) SOPs and Templates</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG PCR SOPs and templates are developed by NHG Group Research to
provide detailed procedures on conducting research in accordance with applicable
guidelines and regulations.</p>
