<p>Medical breakthroughs are occurring at lightning speed. Our clinician
scientists are bringing treatments and improved care to patients every
day through interdisciplinary studies in all areas of research.</p>
<p>They see the patients’ needs every day at the bedside, bring these needs
to the laboratories and translate their discoveries into clinical applications,
that help to transform quality of patient’s life and healthcare delivery.
Some examples of their research include new drugs to treat diseases and
medical devices such as diagnostic test kits to increase sensitivity and
efficiency of diagnosis.</p>
<p>These clinician-scientists have made leading-edge advances hand-in-hand
with the assistance of healthy study volunteers - people who willingly
participate in clinical studies that help determine if research ideas hold
promise for better treatments, prevention and cures.</p>
<h4><strong>A Special Opportunity to Participate in Research</strong></h4>
<p>A clinical trial is a research study to answer specific questions about
new therapies or new ways of using known treatments. Clinical trials, also
called medical research or research studies, are used to determine whether
new drugs or treatments are both safe and effective. Carefully conducted
clinical trials are the fastest and safest way to find treatments that
work in people.</p>
<p>Volunteers come from all walks of life and can be of any gender or age.
Studies need healthy volunteers as well as ones who have an illness or
inherited disorder, and welcome people of all cultural, ethnic and racial
backgrounds.</p>
<p>Choosing to participate in a research study is an important personal decision.
Some volunteers do so because they have a desire to give back to the community
and help keep medicine moving forward. Others, who may have a condition
that has not responded to conventional methods, welcome the opportunity
to have access to novel treatment not available anywhere else. Whatever
the reason for volunteering, each and every volunteer is crucial in shaping
the future of medicine.</p>
<p>Your participation in any research study is voluntary and entirely up
to you. Your decision not to take part or to stop your participation in
a research study will not affect your medical care or any benefits to which
you are normally entitled.</p>
