<p>Choosing to participate in a research activity is a very important decision.</p>
<p>The following information is written with the aim to help you understand
the issues surrounding research and perhaps address some concerns relating
to participating in research.</p>
<p>It is often helpful to talk to a doctor, family members, or friends about
deciding to join a research study.</p>

<h4><strong>About Clinical Research</strong></h4>

<summary>What is Clinical Research?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Clinical Research is research conducted in human volunteers to answer
scientific health questions. Clinical Research helps to determine the safety
and effectiveness of experimental drugs or devices. Clinical research is
commonly described as a&nbsp; “Clinical Trial”, “Clinical Study” or an
“Experiment”. Clinical Research is not the same as Clinical Treatment.</p>

<summary>Why is Research important?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Research is an essential process in the search for better, faster and
cheaper alternatives to existing treatment and diagnostic options. Research
has the potential to uncover important knowledge that can improve our quality
of life.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>What are the various types of Research?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There are many unanswered questions in healthcare. Research studies are
designed to answer some of these questions. The research design varies
with the research question being asked. Some of the more common types of
research are:</p>
<p><strong>Interventional research</strong> is designed to determine whether
a new treatment, new combination of drugs, a new device, a new surgical
intervention, or new radiation therapy is safe and effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prevention research</strong> is designed to look for better ways
to prevent disease. These include research on drugs, vitamins, vaccines,
minerals, and lifestyle changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic research</strong> studies are conducted to find better
tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screening research</strong> studies test the best way to detect
certain diseases or health conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Epidemiological research</strong> tries to answer health issues
in large groups of people or populations in natural settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Life research</strong> explores ways to improve comfort
and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness.</p>

<summary>What happens during a Research Study?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Research Team, which may include Doctors, Nurses and other healthcare
professionals, will check the health of the Participant at the beginning
of the Research Study and screen the Participant using specific inclusion
/ exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>A Participant who is found to be eligible will be enrolled into the research
study, should he or she consent to participate in the research, and the
research team will perform the research related activities according to
the research protocol. Research Participants might have more tests and
doctor visits than patients who are not participating in the research.</p>

<summary>What are phases of Clinical Trials?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The process of development of a new drug involves various phases. Before
a drug is study in humans it undergoes extensive pre-clinical testing.
Here is a simple description of the four phases of a clinical trial:</p>
<p><strong>Phase I </strong>: This first phase is carried out to assess the
safety of the new drug. Only small groups of volunteers (20-80) are recruited
for this phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase II </strong>: Once a drug is shown to be safe in Phase I
testing, it goes on to phase II trials to test the efficacy. In Phase II,
a larger group (100-300) of patients with the disease is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase III </strong>: During this phase, the drug efficacy is determined
and larger group of population (1,000-3,000) is recruited. Results from
phase III helps pharmaceutical drugs gain further knowledge on the drug's
effectiveness, benefits and range of possible adverse reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase IV</strong> :This phase is also known as the post marketing
phase. Phase IV clinical aim to determine how a particular drug compares
to other currently available drugs especially with regards to long term
safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness.</p>

<summary>What is Randomization?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In some Research Studies, Participants are randomised (equivalent to "tossing
of coin") into treatment groups. In some of these studies, neither the
Participant nor the Researchers may know what treatment the Participants
would receive during the Research Study.</p>

<h4><strong>Participating in Research</strong></h4>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Why do people participate in a Research Study?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There are various reasons why people volunteer to be a research participant.
The usual reasons why people participate in a research study are that they
feel they are able to play a more active role in their own health care,
gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available.
Many people also participate in research for an altruistic reason - to
help increase medical knowledge that will help future patients.</p>

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Who can participate in a Research Study? &nbsp;</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Each research study has a specific set of criteria to determine who can
participate in the research, known as the eligibility criteria. The factors
that allow someone to participate in a research are called "inclusion criteria"
and those that disallow someone from participating are called "exclusion
criteria". These criteria are based on factors such as age, gender, the
disease under study, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.</p>
<p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to identify appropriate
participants and keep them safe. The criteria help ensure that researchers
will be able to answer the research questions they plan to study. Before
joining a research, a participant is screened using these criteria to determine
whether he or she qualifies for participation in the study.

<details class="isomer-details">
<summary>Is it safe to participate in Research Study? &nbsp;</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Many people fear that participating in medical research will result in
them taking drugs of unknown dosage or undergo some unproven dangerous
treatments. Some may have concerns where and how the research results may
be used or who will gain access to the results.
<br>
<br>The ethical and legal codes that govern medical practice also apply to
research. In addition, there are numerous regulations and guidelines that
have in place safeguards to protect the participants.
<br>
<br>NHG has a robust Human Subjects Protection Program to protect the safety
and well being of research participants. All research studies conducted
in NHG are reviewed by an independent ethics committee called the Domain
Specific Review Board (DSRB). Only research that is approved by the DSRB
can be conducted in NHG. The DSRB is composed of medical doctors, paramedical
staff, statisticians, and lay people who collectively review all research
proposals to ensure that the research is ethical and the rights, safety
and welfare of research participants are protected.</p>

<summary>What is Informed Consent? &nbsp;</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Informed consent is the process in which the researcher provides adequate
information to a potential participant to assist him or her in making an
informed decision on whether or not to participate in the study. This information
includes details about the study, such as its purpose, duration, required
procedures, potential risks and potential benefits. The participant is
provided with an Informed Consent Form with all these details. The participant
is given the time to think carefully about the study and the opportunity
to ask questions before making a decision. Informed consent is not a binding
contract, and the participant may withdraw from participating in the research
at any time.</p>
