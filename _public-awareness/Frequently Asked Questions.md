<p>Choosing to participate in a research activity is a very important decision.</p>
<p>The following information is written with the aim to help you understand
the issues surrounding research and perhaps address some concerns relating
to participating in research.</p>
<p>It is often helpful to talk to a doctor, family members, or friends about
deciding to join a research study.</p>

<h4><strong>About Clinical Research</strong></h4>

<summary>What is Clinical Research?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Clinical Research is research conducted in human volunteers to answer
scientific health questions. Clinical Research helps to determine the safety
and effectiveness of experimental drugs or devices. Clinical research is
commonly described as a&nbsp; “Clinical Trial”, “Clinical Study” or an
“Experiment”. Clinical Research is not the same as Clinical Treatment.</p>

<summary>Why is Research important?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Research is an essential process in the search for better, faster and
cheaper alternatives to existing treatment and diagnostic options. Research
has the potential to uncover important knowledge that can improve our quality
of life.</p>

<summary>What are the various types of Research?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>There are many unanswered questions in healthcare. Research studies are
designed to answer some of these questions. The research design varies
with the research question being asked. Some of the more common types of
research are:</p>
<p><strong>Interventional research</strong> is designed to determine whether
a new treatment, new combination of drugs, a new device, a new surgical
intervention, or new radiation therapy is safe and effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Prevention research</strong> is designed to look for better ways
to prevent disease. These include research on drugs, vitamins, vaccines,
minerals, and lifestyle changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic research</strong> studies are conducted to find better
tests or procedures for diagnosing a particular disease or condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Screening research</strong> studies test the best way to detect
certain diseases or health conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Epidemiological research</strong> tries to answer health issues
in large groups of people or populations in natural settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Quality of Life research</strong> explores ways to improve comfort
and the quality of life for individuals with a chronic illness.</p>

<summary>What happens during a Research Study?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The Research Team, which may include Doctors, Nurses and other healthcare
professionals, will check the health of the Participant at the beginning
of the Research Study and screen the Participant using specific inclusion
/ exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>A Participant who is found to be eligible will be enrolled into the research
study, should he or she consent to participate in the research, and the
research team will perform the research related activities according to
the research protocol. Research Participants might have more tests and
doctor visits than patients who are not participating in the research.</p>

<summary>What are phases of Clinical Trials?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>The process of development of a new drug involves various phases. Before
a drug is study in humans it undergoes extensive pre-clinical testing.
Here is a simple description of the four phases of a clinical trial:</p>
<p><strong>Phase I </strong>: This first phase is carried out to assess the
safety of the new drug. Only small groups of volunteers (20-80) are recruited
for this phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase II </strong>: Once a drug is shown to be safe in Phase I
testing, it goes on to phase II trials to test the efficacy. In Phase II,
a larger group (100-300) of patients with the disease is involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase III </strong>: During this phase, the drug efficacy is determined
and larger group of population (1,000-3,000) is recruited. Results from
phase III helps pharmaceutical drugs gain further knowledge on the drug's
effectiveness, benefits and range of possible adverse reactions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phase IV</strong> :This phase is also known as the post marketing
phase. Phase IV clinical aim to determine how a particular drug compares
to other currently available drugs especially with regards to long term
safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness.</p>

<summary>What is Randomization?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>In some Research Studies, Participants are randomised (equivalent to "tossing
of coin") into treatment groups. In some of these studies, neither the
Participant nor the Researchers may know what treatment the Participants
would receive during the Research Study.</p>

<summary>Who sponsors Research?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Research is sponsored or funded by various bodies such as hospitals, foundations,
voluntary groups, and pharmaceutical companies, in addition to government
agencies such as the A* STAR and National Medical Research Council.</p>
