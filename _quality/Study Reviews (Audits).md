<h4><strong>Study Reviews (Audits)</strong></h4>
<p>Regular study reviews (audits) are essential to ensure compliance of research
being conducted in NHG and its partner institutions. The focus of study
reviews is to help investigators with proper conduct of research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Random study reviews are conducted by the NHG Research Quality Management
(RQM) Unit. Study reviews may also be initiated for cause i.e. when a review
is initiated to investigate issues or complaints. For cause study reviews
may be conducted by the NHG RQM Unit or by external auditors appointed
by NHG Group Research &amp; Innovation.</p>
<p>Some of the reasons for initiating for cause reviews include:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Request by Investigator/other members of the research team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request by Institutional Representatives/other staff of the institution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request by DSRB/REC&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject/family member of subject complaints</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Study reviews may be conducted onsite, remotely, or a combination of both
(hybrid).</p>
<p>Site visits would generally involve an opening meeting with the PI and
study team, followed by a review of the study documentation and facilities.
At the end of the visit, a close out meeting would be conducted to discuss
any observations and findings noted with the PI and study team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of review may include the following but not limited to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>IRB/Regulatory Applications and Approvals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study Team Delegation, Training and Qualifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informed Consent Process and Documentation (e.g. signed ICF)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject Recruitment Process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Collection and Source Documentation (e.g. medical records, completed
study forms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Biological Specimen Management&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigational Product Management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigator File</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research Database</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Appropriate measures and remedies to rectify any non-compliance or inadequacies
detected during study reviews will be recommended in the detailed audit
report. The PI would be required to take actions in accordance to auditorâ€™s
recommendations and submit a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan
within a stipulated timeline.</p>
