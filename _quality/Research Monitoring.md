<h4><strong>Research Quality Framework â€“ NHG Monitoring Programme</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING THERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS, CELL AND GENE THERAPY AND/ OR COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH PRODUCTS REGULATED BY THE HEALTH SCIENCES AUTHORITY (HSA)</strong>
<br>
<br>Monitoring is a function that is mandated by ICH-GCP for the conduct of
Clinical Trials that are regulated by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA)
under the Health Products Act and Medicines Act.
<br>
<br>For <strong>Industry-Sponsored</strong> Clinical Trials, it is the responsibility
of the Sponsor to establish a thorough monitoring system.
<br>
<br>For <strong>Principal Investigator (PI)-Initiated</strong> Clinical Trials,
the monitoring function is usually performed by the Institution/Investigator.</p>
<p>
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HUMAN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH (HBR) STUDIES REGULATED BY THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH (MOH)</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA), part 5, section 23(2),
each Research Institution (RI) is required to supervise, review and proactively
monitor its human biomedical research (HBR) studies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In NHG, a monitoring framework was developed to meet this statutory requirement.
The objectives of the NHG Monitoring Programme are to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Safeguard the safety and well-being of the research participants;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure good quality and integrity of the research data; and to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure the conduct of the study is in accordance to applicable regulations,
policies and guidelines</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The NHG Monitoring Programme focuses on PI-Initiated studies conducted
in NHG institutions. The extent of monitoring depends on the nature and
risks of the study and the experience of the PI.
