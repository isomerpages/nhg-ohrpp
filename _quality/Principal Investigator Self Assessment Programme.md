<h4><strong>Principal Investigator (PI) Self-Assessment Programme</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the Quality Assurance Framework, the Principal Investigator
(PI) Self-assessment Programme aims to familiarize PIs with the IRB and
regulatory requirements of proper research conduct and identification of
areas in their conduct of research that may require improvements.</p>
<p>The PI Self-Assessment Form (PISAF) is a tool developed by NHG Research
Quality Management (RQM) Unit for PI(s) to conduct self-assessments.</p>
<p>With effect from July 2016, PIs are to submit the PISAF when requested
by the NHG RQM Unit.</p>
