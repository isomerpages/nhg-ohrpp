<p>Purely administrative changes to TCC documents (such as ICFs) arising
from the rebranding exercise will not require TCC amendment submissions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Guidance on Administrative Modifications</u></strong><u> </u><strong><u>to TCC Documents Due to NHG Rebranding</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Changes Not Requiring TCC Amendment</strong>
</p>
<p>No Amendment (AMD) submission to the TCC is required if changes are strictly
limited to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cluster logo and name updates (ex. NHG -&gt; NHG Health)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Website hyperlink modifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contact email address revisions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other rebranding-related administrative changes in Informed Consent Form</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Documentation Requirements</strong>
</p>
<p>Tissue teams must maintain proper documentation by either:</p>
<p>a) Keeping a tracked changes version showing the modifications made, OR</p>
<p>b) Creating a file note in the Tissue file documenting all administrative
revisions</p>
<p><strong>3. Donor Notification</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Tissue teams have the discretion to determine if existing donors need
to be informed of these administrative changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This decision should be based on the practical impact these changes may
have on donor participation and communication</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Notifying TCC at point of Yearly Renewal</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>When submitting your Status Report Form, if the tissue team has updated
ICFs that have new version numbers or dates due to NHG rebranding, please
include this statement in Section 5(a):</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>"Changes to the ICF reflect NHG rebranding updates only. No content modifications
were made."</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This clarification will help expedite review by confirming that ICF changes
are administrative rather than substantive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Important Notes</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>This guidance applies only to purely administrative changes related to
rebranding</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other modifications still require standard TCC amendment procedures</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
