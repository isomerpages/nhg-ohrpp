<p>A*STAR Research Entities (ARES), National Healthcare Group (NHG), Nanyang
Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS)
and SingHealth (SHS) have entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement streamlining
the ethics review procedures for Collaborative Studies to avoid duplicative
review.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With effect from <strong><u>1 April 2025</u></strong>, all <u>new</u> IRB
applications involving A*STAR, NHG, NTU, NUHS, NUS and SingHealth sites,
or their Partner Institutions, are eligible to benefit from the IRBs mutual
recognition arrangement and have their studies reviewed by a single IRB.</p>
