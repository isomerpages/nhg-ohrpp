<p><strong>DSRB-271023: Re-Classification of Studies involving Anonymised Data and/or Human Biological Material as Review Not Required</strong>
</p>
<p>Effective <strong><u>01 Nov 2023</u></strong>:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Studies involving <strong>anonymised data/ human biological materials</strong> will
no longer require review by the NHG Domain Specific Review Board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This change in policy is aligned with SingHealth and consistent with US
Office for Human Research Protections &amp; Health and Human Services positions
of defining studies involving anonymised data/HBM as not meeting the definition
of human subject research.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studies Impacted by Policy Change:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All new studies involving only anonymised data/HBM do not require DSRB
review. If submitted to DSRB, the study will receive a Review Not Required
Outcome.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously approved applications using anonymised data/HBM may request
to be re-classified as Review Not Required (RNR); simply submit a Study
Status Report Form (SRF) for DSRB to conduct the re-determination. In the
SRF, the researcher should indicate that the study status is “Terminated”
and specify that only anonymised data/HBM are studied, thus pending DSRB
review to cease oversight. Please submit such SRF requests by 01 Feb 2024.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Impact on Institutions and Researchers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A declaration form has been co-created with institution research offices
to enable self-determination and documentation whether a piece of research
involving anonymised data/ HBM can meet the Review Not Required (RNR) criteria.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researchers may use the form to evaluate whether their research involving
anonymised data/HBM can meet the Review Not Required (RNR) criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Researchers may subsequently seek endorsement from their department and
institutional reps to proceed with their research that meets the RNR criteria
and retain the endorsed form as proof of review.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Institutions may continue to request researchers to submit their research
applications on ROAM when there is ambiguity whether the study meets the
RNR criteria.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
