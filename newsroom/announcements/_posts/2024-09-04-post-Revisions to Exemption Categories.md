<p><strong>Normal Educational Practices and Settings</strong>
</p>
<p>Research conducted in established or commonly accepted educational settings,
that specifically involves normal educational practices, that are not likely
to adversely impact students’ opportunity to learn required educational
content or the assessment of educators who provide instruction.</p>
<p>Examples of such research are:</p>

<li>
<p>Research on regular and special education instructional strategies; or</p>

<p>Research on the effectiveness of or the comparison among instructional
techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods.</p>

<p><strong>Educational Tests, Surveys, Interviews, or Observations</strong>
</p>
<p>Research that only includes interactions involving educational tests (cognitive,
diagnostic, aptitude, achievement), survey procedures, interview procedures,
or observation of public behaviour (including visual or auditory recording)
if at least one of the following criteria is met:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner
that the identity of human subjects cannot readily be ascertained, directly
or through identifiers linked to the subjects; or</p>

<li>
<p>Any disclosure of the human subjects’ responses outside of the research
would not reasonably place subjects at risk of psychological harm or criminal
or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’ financial standing,
employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner
that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly
or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and the IRB conducts a limited
IRB review to determine adequate provisions to protect the privacy of the
subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data are in place.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If research includes children, only observation of public behaviour and
educational tests without investigators’ intervention is permitted. Education
tests, surveys, and interviews with investigators involvement as well as
conditions meeting point (iii) above may not be applied to children.</p>

<p><strong>Benign Behavioural Interventions</strong>
</p>
<p>Research involving benign behavioral interventions in conjunction with
the collection of information from an adult subject through verbal or written
responses (including data entry) or audiovisual recording if the subject
prospectively agrees to the intervention and information collection and
at least one of the following criteria is met:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner
that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained,
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects; or</p>

<li>
<p>Any disclosure of the human subjects’ responses outside the research would
not reasonably place the subjects at risk of psychological harm or criminal
or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects’ financial standing,
employability, educational advancement, or reputation; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The information obtained is recorded by the investigator in such a manner
that the identity of the human subjects can readily be ascertained, directly
or through identifiers linked to the subjects, and the IRB conducts a limited
IRB review to determine adequate provisions to protect the privacy of the
subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data are in place.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>A. For the purpose of this provision, benign behavioural interventions
are brief in duration, harmless, painless, not physically invasive, not
likely to have a significant adverse lasting impact on the subjects, and
the investigator has no reason to think the subjects will find the interventions
offensive or embarrassing. Provided all such criteria are met, examples
of such benign behavioral interventions would include having the subjects
play an online game, having them solve puzzles under various noise conditions,
or having them decide how to allocate a nominal amount of received cash
between themselves and someone else.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>B. If the research involves deceiving the subjects regarding the nature
or purposes of the research, this exemption is not applicable unless the
subject authorises the deception through a prospective agreement to participate
in research in circumstances in which the subject is informed that he or
she will be unaware of or misled regarding the nature or purposes of the
research.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Research for which Consent is Not Required</strong>
</p>
<p>Secondary research uses of identifiable private information or identifiable
biospecimens, if at least one of the following criteria is met:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens are
publicly available; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information, which may include information about biospecimens, is recorded
by the investigator in such a manner that the identity of the human subjects
cannot readily be ascertained, and the investigator will neither contact
the subjects nor re-identify the subjects.</p>

<p>It is no longer a requirement for data or biospecimens to be existing.
Data or biospecimens may be collected prospectively, provided the information
is either publicly available, or is recorded by the investigator in such
a manner that the identity of the human subjects cannot readily be ascertained,
and the investigator will neither contact nor re-identify the subjects.</p>
