<p>The<strong> </strong>ICH E6 (R3) GCP Principles and Annex 1 will be effective <strong><u>1 January 2026</u></strong> in
Singapore.</p>
<p>The E6 (R3) guideline outlines GCP principles within the changing environment
of clinical trials, fostering innovations in trial design, operational
methods, and technological <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">progress</a>.
It advocates for a quality-by-design and risk-proportionate strategy in
conducting clinical trials.</p>
<p>It is crucial for <strong>all investigators</strong> and <strong>other study team members involved in significant trial-related tasks</strong> to
be knowledgeable about the ICH E6 (R3) GCP requirements to ensure ethical
standards and subject safety in clinical trials, ultimately enhancing the <u>credibility and reliability </u>of
trial outcomes.</p>
