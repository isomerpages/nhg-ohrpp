<h4><strong>About NHG Research Quality Management Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG Research Quality Management (RQM) Programme is dedicated to promoting
the proper conduct of research and fostering a research culture grounded
in high ethical standards. Our programme collaborates closely with the
NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to ensure compliance with all applicable
regulations, as well as local and international guidelines.</p>
<h4><strong>Programme Overview</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Establishment and Governance</strong>
</p>
<p>The NHG RQM Programme was established under the Office of Human Research
Protection Programme (OHRPP). While it reports to the NHG Research Ethics
Committee, it remains independent of the NHG DSRB.</p>
<p><strong>Scope</strong>
</p>
<p>The NHG RQM Programme applies to all research studies conducted within
NHG and its partner institutions. This includes studies approved by the
NHG DSRB or external Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) with collaborative
agreements with NHG.</p>
