<h4><strong>Establishment</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>NHG Research Quality Management (RQM) Programme</strong> is
dedicated to promoting the proper conduct of research and fostering a research
culture grounded in high ethical standards. The NHG RQM Programme collaborates
closely with the NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to ensure compliance
with all applicable regulations, as well as local and international guidelines.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Scope</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG RQM Programme applies to all research studies conducted within
NHG and its partner institutions. This includes studies approved by the
NHG DSRB or external Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) with collaborative
agreements with NHG.</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Governance</strong></h4>
<p>The NHG RQM Programme was established under the NHG Office of Human Research
Protection Programme (OHRPP). While it reports to the NHG Research Ethics
Committee, it remains independent of the NHG DSRB.</p>
