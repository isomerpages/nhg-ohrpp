<h4><strong>Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB)</strong></h4>
<p>Since its inception in 2004, the DSRB has been providing comprehensive
ethics review of research protocols to protect the rights, safety and well-being
of human subjects in NHG institutions and our partner NUHS.</p>
<p>The DSRB comprises of six biomedical domains: Domains A to F. These Domains
based on broad but related disease groupings while Domain F focuses on
Population Health.</p>
<p>The NHG DSRB has been accredited by the US-based Association for Accreditation
of Human Research Protection Program (AAHRPP) since 2007, a recognition
for its high standards in human subject protection.</p>

<h4><strong>Research Quality Management (RQM)</strong></h4>
<p>The Research Quality Management unit provides quality assurance activities
to ensure that research protocols approved by the DSRB are carried out
ethically and in accordance with all applicable regulations, particularly
the Singapore Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (SGGCP) and NHG Proper
Conduct of Research SOPs.</p>
<p>The RQM unit also undertakes continuous improvement initiatives with the
DSRB to ensure and continue high quality and efficient review of research
applications.</p>

<h4><strong>Partnerships &amp; Outreach (P&amp;O)</strong></h4>
<p>The Partnership &amp; Outreach unit oversees the extension of ethics review
services and oversight to external healthcare set-ups and agencies.</p>
<p>Such research partnerships provide a common platform of ethics review
and establish common standards of research conduct in the different institutions.
The team also coordinates public education efforts to create a better-informed
population on their participation in clinical trials or clinical research.</p>

<h4><strong>Research Education (RE)</strong></h4>
<p>The Research Education unit is responsible for developing training programs
and implementing educational support initiatives for investigators, clinical
research coordinators and other clinical research professionals.</p>
<p>This unit also oversees the propagation of Responsible Conduct of Research
(RCR) culture and education within the research community.</p>
