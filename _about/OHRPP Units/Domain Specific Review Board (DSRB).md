<p>The NHG <strong>Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB)</strong> is an independent
committee constituted of medical, scientific and non-scientific members.
Since its inception in 2004, the DSRB has been providing comprehensive
ethics review of research protocols to protect the rights, safety and well-being
of human subjects in NHG institutions and our partner NUHS.</p>
<p>The DSRBâ€™s responsibility is to ensure the protection of the rights, safety,
and well-being of human subjects involved in a research study by reviewing,
approving, and providing continuing review of research studies, protocols
and amendments, and of the methods and materials to be used in obtaining
and documenting informed consent of the research participants.</p>
<p>The DSRB is empowered by the NHG Group CEO, to review research involving
patients, staff, premises, or facilities of NHG institutions and all other
institutions under its oversight. Other officials of institutions which
conduct research under the oversight of NHG DSRB may not override the decision
of DSRB (or REC, where applicable).</p>
<p>The DSRB has also been accredited by the US-based Association for Accreditation
of Human Research Protection Program (AAHRPP) since 2007, a recognition
for its high standards in human subject protection.</p>
<p>The DSRB comprises of six biomedical domains: Domains A to F. These Domains
based on broad but related disease groupings while Domain F focuses on
Population Health.</p>

<p>Each Board is constituted in compliance with the Singapore Guideline for
Good Clinical Practice. This arrangement ensures that more appropriate
expertise can be concentrated within each Domain to assess the scientific
and ethical merits of the protocols submitted for ethics review.</p>
