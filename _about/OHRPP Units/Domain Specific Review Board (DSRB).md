<p>Since its inception in 2004, the DSRB has been providing comprehensive
ethics review of research protocols to protect the rights, safety and well-being
of human subjects in NHG institutions and our partner NUHS.</p>
<p>The DSRB comprises of six biomedical domains: Domains A to F. These Domains
based on broad but related disease groupings while Domain F focuses on
Population Health.</p>
<p>The NHG DSRB has been accredited by the US-based Association for Accreditation
of Human Research Protection Program (AAHRPP) since 2007, a recognition
for its high standards in human subject protection.</p>
