<h4><strong>Why does AAHRPP-Accreditation matter?</strong></h4>
<p>To earn AAHRPP accreditation, each organization goes through a rigorous
evaluation process, including a thorough site visit by experts in Human
Research Protection.</p>
<p>AAHRPP-accredited organizations also have systems in place to monitor
the well-being of research participants. To keep its accreditation, the
institutions are required to submit annual reports to AAHRPP and must undergo
site visits at scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>NHG's record of full AAHRPP accreditation since 2007 is a testament to
the quality and efficiency of our research conduct and commitment in Human
Subject Protection, in conjunction to strive for research excellence. Research
participants can trust that our researchers will put their safety and well-being
as a top priority.</p>
<h4><strong>4th Full AAHRPP Accreditation in March 2020</strong></h4>
<p>NHG was successfully awarded Full Accreditation by the Council on Accreditation
of the Association for the Accreditation of Human Research Protection Programs,
Inc. (AAHRPP) in March 2020.</p>
<p>This is NHG’s fourth successful accreditation of its Human Research Protection
Programme (HRPP). The first three accreditations were awarded in 2007,
2010 and 2015 respectively. This prestigious award is an assurance of NHG’s
international standing in delivering a quality HRPP, and validates NHG’s
commitment to the protection of human subjects.</p>
<p>The re-accreditation of NHG HRPP also covers research activities in National
University Health System (NUHS) and National University of Singapore (NUS)
Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health
and Faculty of Dentistry.</p>
<p>This significant achievement was the result of persistent dedicated efforts
towards protecting human subjects, by senior management, research leaders
and staff from NHG and affiliated institutions, members of the Domain Specific
Review Board (DSRB), with the Office of Human Research Protection Programme
(OHRPP).</p>
<p>The AAHRPP Council on Accreditation commended NHG HRPP on its robust process
to ensure that appropriate policies and procedures were in place for the
adequate protection of human research participants for new institutions
coming under its oversight as an area of distinction.</p>
<p>NHG was also commended for its strength - the DSRB on their depth of knowledge,
experience and expertise for each board, and the Research Quality Management
and Research Education groups for the extensive programs of research auditing
and education carried out.</p>
