<h4><strong>Why does AAHRPP-Accreditation matter?</strong></h4>
<p>To earn AAHRPP accreditation, each organization goes through a rigorous
evaluation process, including a thorough site visit by experts in Human
Research Protection.</p>
<p>AAHRPP-accredited organizations also have systems in place to monitor
the well-being of research participants. To keep its accreditation, the
institutions are required to submit annual reports to AAHRPP and must undergo
site visits at scheduled intervals.</p>
<p>NHG Health's record of full AAHRPP accreditation since 2007 is a testament
to the quality and efficiency of our research conduct and commitment in
Human Subject Protection, in conjunction to strive for research excellence.
Research participants can trust that our researchers will put their safety
and well-being as a top priority.</p>
<h4><strong>5th Full AAHRPP Accreditation in June 2025 </strong></h4>
<p>NHG Health was successfully awarded Full Accreditation by the Council

<p>This is NHG Health’s fifth successful accreditation of its Human Research
Protection Programme (HRPP). The first four accreditations were awarded

assurance of NHG Health’s international standing in delivering a quality

<p>The re-accreditation of NHG Health HRPP also covers research activities
in National University Health System (NUHS) and National University of
Singapore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Saw Swee Hock School of
Public Health and Faculty of Dentistry.</p>

towards protecting human subjects, by senior management, research leaders
and staff from NHG Health and affiliated institutions, members of the Domain
Specific Review Board (DSRB), with the Office of Human Research Protection
Programme (OHRPP).</p>
<p>The AAHRPP Council on Accreditation has recognised NHG Health's HRPP for
its continual institutional leadership support that enables a well-integrated,
systematic and comprehensive HRPP.</p>
<p>The integration and infrastructure throughout the institutions allows
for streamlined collaboration and continuity of operations and communication,
while our committed staff promote a culture of partnership and accessibility.</p>

improvement, reflecting our ongoing dedication to enhancing research protection
standards throughout the organisation.</p>
