<p>The NHG Research Institution (RI) is responsible for ensuring that all
human biomedical research conducted under its supervision and control is
in compliance with the HBRA.</p>
<p>For the purpose of coordinating research across collaborative studies,
the RI of the submitting/lead Principal Investigator will be assumed as
the lead RI.</p>
<p><strong>About the RI Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>The RI Policy outlines the functions and duties of NHG RI and duties of
the NHG Principal Person In Charge (PIC) to fulfill the requirements of
the HBRA and describes the NHG research governance framework that enables
the RI to meet the requirements of the HBRA and other relevant Acts and
regulations applicable to research. This also outlines the roles and responsibilities
of the following committees that provide oversight of human biomedical
research (HBR) activities in NHG:</p>

<p><strong>Clinical Trials involving Therapeutic Products, Cell and Gene Therapy and/or Complementary Health Products regulated by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Monitoring is a function that is mandated by ICH-GCP for the conduct of
Clinical Trials that are regulated by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA)
under the Health Products Act and Medicines Act.</p>
<p>For Industry-Sponsored Clinical Trials, it is the responsibility of the
Sponsor to establish a thorough monitoring system.</p>
<p>For Principal Investigator (PI)-Initiated Clinical Trials, the monitoring
function is usually performed by the Institution/Investigator.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Human Biomedical Research Studies regulated by the Ministry Of Health (MOH)</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA), part 5, section 23(2),
each Research Institution (RI) is required to supervise, review and proactively
monitor its human biomedical research (HBR) studies.</p>
<p>In NHG, a monitoring framework was developed to meet this statutory requirement.
The objectives of the NHG Monitoring Programme are to:</p>
<p>(i) Safeguard the safety and well-being of the research participants;</p>
<p>(ii) Ensure good quality and integrity of the research data; and to</p>
<p>(iii) Ensure the conduct of the study is in accordance to applicable regulations,
policies and guidelines</p>
<p>The NHG Monitoring Programme focuses on PI-Initiated studies conducted
in NHG institutions. The extent of monitoring depends on the nature and
risks of the study and the experience of the PI.</p>
