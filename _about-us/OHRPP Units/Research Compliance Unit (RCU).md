<summary><strong>Execution of Proactive Monitoring Framework</strong>
</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Under the Human Biomedical Research Act (HBRA), part 5, section 23(2),
each Research Institution (RI) is required to supervise, review and proactively
monitor its human biomedical research (HBR) studies.</p>
<p>In NHG, a monitoring framework was developed to meet this statutory requirement.
The objectives of the NHG Monitoring Programme are to:</p>
<p>(i) Safeguard the safety and well-being of the research participants;</p>
<p>(ii) Ensure good quality and integrity of the research data; and to</p>
<p>(iii) Ensure the conduct of the study is in accordance to applicable regulations,
policies and guidelines</p>
<p>The NHG Monitoring Programme focuses on PI-Initiated studies conducted
in NHG institutions. The extent of monitoring depends on the nature and
risks of the study and the experience of the PI.</p>
