<p>The NHG Research Quality Management (RQM) Programme is dedicated to promoting
the proper conduct of research and fostering a research culture grounded
in high ethical standards. Our programme collaborates closely with the
NHG Domain Specific Review Board (DSRB) to ensure compliance with all applicable
regulations, as well as local and international guidelines.</p>
