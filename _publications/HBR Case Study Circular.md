<p>In an effort to educate the NHG research community on the Human Tissue
Framework, the Tissue Secretariat have initiated a publication series called
“Tissue Compliance Circular” for tissue custodians and individuals involved
in tissue banking activities.</p>
<p>The Circulars are organized by their release dates.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: These Circulars are access-restricted to NHG Staff. NHG-Intranet access is required before they can be downloaded.</strong>

<p>Attention: MOH Update On The Governance Of Leftover Tissue.
<br>Do you have any ongoing studies which mayhave leftover tissue to be used
for futureresearch after the study is completed?
<br>
<br>If so, in order to use the leftover tissue for future research, you may
need to ensure that study participants have been consented with all the
HBRA 12(2) elements.
<br>1. Informed consent requirements and whether registration with TCC is
required under these 2 scenarios
<br>a) Storage of leftover human tissue for future research not yet approved
by IRB
<br>b) Use/storage of leftover tissue for a HBR study that had already been
approved by the IRB.
<br>

to the requirements of the HBR framework; do not need to be regulated under
the HTF.
<br>2. Leftover tissue stored for a future research yet to obtain IRB approval
