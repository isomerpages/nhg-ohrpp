<p>In an effort to educate the NHG research community on the Human Tissue
Framework, the Tissue Secretariat have initiated a publication series called
“Tissue Compliance Circular” for tissue custodians and individuals involved
in tissue banking activities.</p>
<p>The Circulars are organized by their release dates.</p>
