<h4><strong>Chicken Soup for the Busy Coordinator</strong></h4>
<p>The <strong>Clinical Research Coordinator Society (CRCS)</strong> is aware
that our multi-tasking coordinators often have to deal with ambiguous problems
and situations.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Society launched the regular Chicken Soup emails
in January 2008. These emails serve as bite-size educational resources
for Clinical Research Coordinators.
<br>
<br>Published by the CRCS, the monthly Chicken Soup emails are easy to read
and contain essential information and practical knowledge that can be applied
at work. We hope that the Chicken Soup will indeed be a nourishing resource
for you!</p>
