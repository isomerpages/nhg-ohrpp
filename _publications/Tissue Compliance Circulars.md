<p>In an effort to educate the NHG Health research community on the Human
Tissue Framework, the Tissue Secretariat have initiated a publication series
called “Tissue Compliance Circular” for tissue custodians and individuals
involved in tissue banking activities.</p>
<p>The Circulars are organized by their release dates.</p>
